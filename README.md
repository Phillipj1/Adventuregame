# Adventuregame

I decided to make a game inspired by the novel Beowulf. As a computer science major, you'd think it would be a no-brainer to build something that would be perfectly up my alley. But I'm new to coding; I know the fundamentals and nomenclature of the Python programming language. I've made little games and projects from lessons to assist me improve my coding skills. Apart than that, I haven't done anything significant. So I figured this could end up being the first, the time and effort was worthwhile. I won't lie, I wasn't very intrigued in Beowulf because I had already read the book in the past. However, the ability to make a game made this a lot of fun. In Python coding language, I created a text adventure game featuring book-related questions and riddles. How do you win, you may ask? Once you've solved all of the problems, you'll be able to obtain a magical potion that will save Beowulf's life. Overall, the game is testing knowledge your on the book, and it's more fun than it took to seriously. While playing, you may appear to be all over the place; you may be in one spot if you move left, then in another if you look right. Things and individuals will be asking questions, and if you don't get it right, you can't go on.  
I chose to develop the game in Python rather than using the text adventure website because I needed the practice. Coding is something I want to pursue as a career, and the only way I'll grow and be better is to start developing projects. Having this as my first major assignment provided me with everything I needed. Making something from scratch, getting it to operate without issues, and finishing it in a short amount of time are all things I'll have to get
accustomed to. I watched at least six different videos on Python algorithms when I first started. I needed to have the computer respond to many answers; once I learned how to add that i could ask whatever question I wanted. I watched additional videos about Importing Python's gTTS module for text and syntax. Although writing the game's back end was the most time challenging, making the story of the game wasn't the easiest of things. I went back over the book's content and utilized notes from class to help me come up with some puzzles and questions. I didn't want to make the riddles too difficult since I wanted to design something that even if you didn't read the book, you could still play or if you knew some information about Beowulf. I utilized you (the player) and Beowulf as main characters. I also incorporated creatures that were referenced in the book and found in the surrounding area and time range. This is most likely the best project I've worked on all year, every minute of it was awesome. The whole game produced over 430 lines of code and I enjoyed every minute of it writing. It was a terrific and engaging learning experience; I loved how interactive fiction made the reading academic project enjoyable and exciting.
